## ArkTreeCalc
users can create Lost Ark skill builds outside of the game using a fully customizable replicated Skill Tree from in the game.

## Motivation 
I was stuck in tutorial 'hell' before I created this project, a lot of logic is brute forced, and i just wanted to get something finished from start to end on my own.
I built this as my first real React project. I tried building it with react alone, but realized it was it going to be more time consuming. So i decided to try using react-bootstrap for it and it looks pretty identical to what I was going for. 

## What I Learned
I discovered how important a back end and database is. In this project a lot of images/logic are brute forced with if else statements. The code is really bad and if I were to redo this I would definitely use a back end to store all of the data.
- I was so hung up on finishing the project I literally typed out 100's of directories to images and made images depend on other images with if else statements (skillName.js file)
- React, useState, useEffect, images, dynamic react statements
- deploying on vercel and github pages
- React-bootstrap 
- Routing 
- how long a project can take, the fun it is to be able to build something from scratch.

## Framework/Libraries used
- React
- React-bootstrap
